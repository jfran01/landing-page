The Odin Project Foundations Course Landing Page Project

In this project, I used my acquired knowledge of flexbox to create a landing page with a responsive structure for a fictional product.

### Issues encountered:

1. Nav bar kept surpassing the scope of the screen - leading to the links being cut off and requiring horizontal scrolling
   Fix: Remove width:100% on nav bar - I believe this was an issue with a built-in margin causing content to 'fall' off the page when the full screen width was applied
2. Info card elements were not equally sized
   Fix: change flex-basis of individual cards to 0
